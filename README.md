# Simulating Candyland

I saw @jakevdp 's blog post (http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/12/18/simulating-chutes-and-ladders/) about simulating chutes & ladders and thought that doing a similar simulation for Candyland would be an interesting way to get more aquainted with simulations and using Juptyer Notebooks.
